Hi,

I've completed the Cartpanda practical test. Here are my submissions:

**Live Demo:** [Deploy URL]
**GitHub:** https://github.com/naveedbasharat06/cart-panda

## Part 1: Funnel Builder

Built a fully functional drag-and-drop funnel builder with:

**Core Features:**
- Infinite canvas with pan, zoom, and grid background
- 5 node types with custom components and visual styling
- Drag-from-palette to canvas functionality
- Animated edge connections with arrow direction
- Funnel rules: Thank You blocks outgoing edges, Sales Page warns on multiple outputs, auto-incrementing labels

**Bonus Features:**
- Zoom controls + minimap
- Snap-to-grid (20px)
- Node and edge deletion (keyboard + button)
- Real-time validation panel (orphan nodes, rule violations)
- localStorage auto-save + JSON export/import

**Accessibility:**
- Skip-to-content link
- Full keyboard navigation
- ARIA labels on canvas, controls, and interactive elements
- Visible focus indicators (WCAG AA compliant)

**Tech:** React 18, TypeScript, React Flow, Zustand, Tailwind CSS, Vite

## Part 2: Dashboard Architecture

Documented a scalable approach covering all 7 required topics:
- Feature-based module structure with enforced boundaries
- shadcn/ui + design tokens + Storybook
- TanStack Query + URL state for data management
- Performance: route splitting, virtualization, RUM monitoring
- DX: ESLint boundaries, PR templates, ADRs
- Testing pyramid: Vitest + RTL + Playwright
- Release: feature flags, staged rollouts, Sentry

## Relevant Experience

**KazaSwap** (https://www.kazaswap.co/)
- Complex drag-and-drop interfaces with real-time updates

**Planner AI** (https://planner-ai-dev.netlify.app/)
- Visual workflow builder with connected nodes

I build interfaces that feel clean, responsive, and accessible - the quality level you're looking for.

Best,
Naveed
